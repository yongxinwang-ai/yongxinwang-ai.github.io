Hi! I'm Yongxin Wang, an undergraduate at Nankai University, in the department of Computer Science.
I have a strong interest in transfer learning in the field of Computer Vision. And my current research is
related to a Robust Source-free Test-time Adaptation under time-varying environments, supervised by [Dr. Xialei Liu](https://mmcheng.net/xliu/).
Besides, Generative Model is the direction that I am interested in.
