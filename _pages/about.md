Hi! I'm Yongxin Wang, an undergraduate at Nankai University, in the department of Computer Science.
I have a strong interest in transfer learning in the field of Computer Vision. And my current research is
related to a Robust Source-free Test-time Adaptation under time-varying environments, supervised by [Dr. Xialei Liu](https://mmcheng.net/xliu/).
Besides, Generative Model is the direction that I am interested in.

In Augest 2023, I am going to study in [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), Abu Dhabi, for my Master degree in Computer Vision.
My mentor will be [Shijian Lu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/shijian.lu/).


## How pronounce my name
Yong-xin, is really hard for western people to pronounce "xin" as the sound does exist in all languages apart from Chinese.
So you can also call me "yong-shin" or my English nickname LasseFord, which is easier to pronounce.
