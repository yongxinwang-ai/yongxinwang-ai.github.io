Hi! I'm Yongxin Wang, a first-year student at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) where I'm pursuing my Master degree in Computer Vision. I am working with [Dr. Xiaodan Liang](https://lemondan.github.io/) and [Dr. Zhiqiang Shen](https://zhiqiangshen.com/).Prior to joining MBZUAI, I obtained my B.E. in Computer Science (2019-2023),  supervised by [Dr. Xialei Liu](https://mmcheng.net/xliu/).

I have a strong interest in transfer learning in the field of Computer Vision. And my current research is related to Zero-shot Learning(Multi-model) and Domain Adaptation.

## How pronounce my name
Yong-xin, is really hard for western people to pronounce "xin" as the sound does exist in all languages apart from Chinese.
So you can also call me "yong-shin" or my English nickname LasseFord, which is easier to pronounce.
